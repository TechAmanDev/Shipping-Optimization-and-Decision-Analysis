# Shipping-Optimization-and-Decision-Analysis

Overview
This project demonstrates advanced business analytics skills through two distinct problem-solving scenarios: a shipping optimization problem for Shafer Office Supplies and a decision analysis for a pharmaceutical company's vaccine development program.

Key Components

1. Shipping Optimization
- Objective: Minimize transportation costs for Shafer Office Supplies
- Tools Used: Excel Solver, Sensitivity Analysis
- Key Analyses:
  - Developed an optimization model to minimize total shipping costs
  - Analysed distribution centre capacity utilization
  - Performed sensitivity analysis on supply constraints and shipping costs
  - Conducted a comparative analysis of cost-optimized vs. emissions-optimized shipping plans

2. Decision Analysis for Vaccine Development
- Objective: Determine the optimal strategy for a new vaccine development program
- Tools Used: TreePlan (or manual decision tree in Excel), Expected Value Analysis
- Key Analyses:
  - Created a decision tree model for the pharmaceutical company's options
  - Calculated expected values for different decision paths
  - Performed sensitivity analysis on the probability of successful animal testing
  - Evaluated a potential partnership offer from a rival company

Skills Demonstrated
- Linear Programming and Optimization
- Decision Tree Analysis
- Sensitivity Analysis
- Data Interpretation and Business Insights
- Cost-Benefit Analysis
- Environmental Impact Assessment
- Risk Analysis in Business Decision Making

Key Findings
1. Shipping Optimization:
   - Identified the optimal shipping plan with a minimum cost of $51,510
   - Analysed the trade-offs between cost optimization and emissions reduction
   - Recommended maintaining cost-focused optimization due to significant cost increases (58.8%) for minimal emissions reduction (15.5%)

2. Vaccine Development Decision:
   - Recommended additional animal testing before human trials based on expected value analysis
   - Identified the sensitivity of the decision to the probability of successful animal testing
   - Evaluated the potential benefits of a cost-sharing partnership with a rival company

Tools and Technologies
- Microsoft Excel
- Excel Solver Add-in
- TreePlan Add-in (or manual decision tree construction)

This project showcases the application of advanced analytical techniques to real-world business problems, demonstrating proficiency in data-driven decision-making and strategic analysis.
